## Recap --- the big picture

What we want to know: [Average treatment effect]{.alert}

- Difference in potential outcomes, $Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$
- ...averaged across all units in population

. . .

Key condition for inference: [Independence]{.alert}

- No correlation b/w potential outcomes and assignment to treatment
- Condition on the [assignment mechanism]{.underline}, not the causal effects

. . .

If independence holds: $$\underbrace{\avg[Y_i \mid D_i = 1] - \avg[Y_i \mid D_i = 0]}_{\text{observed diff in means}} \approx \underbrace{\E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}]}_{\text{avg treatment effect}}$$

## Recap --- last class

Randomized experiments as a path to causal inference

#. Essentials of experimental design
   - *Ex ante* prob of treatment should be same for all units
   - Ideal is for treatment and control to be representative of full sample
   
#. Randomization and independence
   - Equal assignment probability $\leadsto$ no correlation of potential outcomes and treatment assignment in population
   - Randomization failure possible in any given sample, but unlikely in large sample

## Today's agenda

1. Going deeper on the Gerber, Green, Larimer experiment
   - How they tailor treatments to address specific questions
   - Downloading their data + analyzing it ourselves
   
2. Limitations of the experimental approach
   - External validity concerns
   - Ethical concerns


# Defining treatment and comparisons

## The research question

Gerber, Green, Larimer 2008 (GGL): How does social pressure affect turnout?

. . .

What's manipulable here?

- Whether someone feels social pressure $\leadsto$ not manipulable
- Explicit exposure to social pressure $\leadsto$ plausibly manipulable

. . .

GGL's intervention: Induce exposure to social pressure via household mailer

## GGL's treatment
### The "Neighbors" condition

![](ggl_neighbors_mailer.png){height=5.5in}
</center>

## Isolating extrinsic pressure

GGL want to know effect of **extrinsic** civic duty considerations

But their mailer is a "bundled treatment", doing many things at once

- Activating extrinsic pressure to vote, as intended
- Activating intrinsic feelings of civic duty
- Letting subjects know they're being studied --- [Hawthorne effect]{.alert}

Comparison to "no mailer" alone wouldn't isolate extrinsic pressure effect

# Analyzing the data

## Getting the data

Posted online at [Yale's institutional data repository](https://isps.yale.edu/research/data/d001)

```{r download}

df_ggl <- read_csv("http://hdl.handle.net/10079/d3669799-4537-411e-b175-d9e837324c35")
print(df_ggl)
```

```{r order}
#| echo: false
## Put treatments in same order as in GGL article
df_ggl <- df_ggl |>
  mutate(treatment = fct_relevel(treatment, "Control", "Civic Duty",
                                 "Hawthorne", "Self"))
```

## Distribution of treatments

How many individuals in each condition?

```{r condition_dist}
#| cache: true
df_ggl |>
  count(treatment) |>
  mutate(percent = 100 * n / sum(n))
```

## Checking for balance: Year of birth

```{r balance_yob}
#| cache: true
ggplot(df_ggl, aes(x = yob, y = treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Checking for balance: Household size

```{r balance_hh_size}
#| cache: true
ggplot(df_ggl, aes(x = hh_size)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ treatment, ncol = 3, scales = "free_y")
```

## Checking for balance: Sex

```{r balance_sex}
#| cache: true
df_ggl |>
  group_by(treatment) |>
  summarize(pct_female = 100 * mean(sex == "female"))
```

## Checking for balance: Voting in prior elections

```{r balance_voting}
#| cache: true
df_ggl |>
  mutate(p2004 = str_to_lower(p2004)) |>  # make consistent w/others
  group_by(treatment) |>
  summarize(across(g2000:p2004, ~ 100 * mean(. == "yes")))
```

## Group averages and differences

```{r averages}
#| cache: true
df_results <- df_ggl |>
  group_by(treatment) |>
  summarize(turnout = 100 * mean(voted == "Yes")) |>
  mutate(vs_control = turnout - turnout[treatment == "Control"],
         vs_civic = turnout - turnout[treatment == "Civic Duty"],
         vs_hawthorne = turnout - turnout[treatment == "Hawthorne"],
         vs_self = turnout - turnout[treatment == "Self"])

print(df_results)
```

## Making relevant comparisons

What's effect of strong social pressure vs no social pressure?

::: {.example}
avg[vote | neighbors] - avg[vote | Hawthorne]
:::

```{r}
df_results$vs_hawthorne[df_results$treatment == "Neighbors"]
```

. . .

<hr>

What's effect of strong social pressure vs weak social pressure?

::: {.example}
avg[vote | neighbors] - avg[vote | self-treatment]
:::

```{r}
df_results$vs_self[df_results$treatment == "Neighbors"]
```

## Making relevant comparisons {visibility="uncounted"}

What's effect of knowing you're being studied?

::: {.example}
avg[vote | Hawthorne] - avg[vote | civic duty]
:::

```{r}
df_results$vs_civic[df_results$treatment == "Hawthorne"]
```

. . .

<hr>

How cost-effective is {mailer} for get-out-the-vote?

::: {.example}
avg[vote | {mailer}] - avg[vote | control]
:::

```{r}
df_results |> select(treatment, vs_control) |> deframe()
```

## Gerber, Green, Larimer: Takeaways

For theories of voting:

- Civic duty considerations positively affect turnout
- Extrinsic motivations outweigh intrinsic motivations

For political practitioners:

- Surveillance + shaming works to get out the vote
- More cost effective than other methods
  - Neighbors mailing: $1.93/vote
  - Self-treatment mailing: $3.24/vote
  - Door-to-door canvassing: $20/vote
  - Phone calls: $35/vote
  

# Limitations of the experimental method

## External validity

What's the actual population the experimental sample was drawn from?

::: {.incremental}
- Registered voters
- ... in Michigan (but not the Upper Peninsula!), in 2006
- ... living on blocks with 90%+ single family homes and 4+ households
- ... who voted in the 2004 general election
- ... who weren't too likely to vote by absentee ballot
- ... or to be Democratic primary voters
:::

::: {.fragment}
If you were trying to get out the vote for the 2023 Nashville mayoral runoff, how confident would you be in using the social pressure strategy?
:::

## Overcoming external validity concerns

[Replication]{.alert} of similar experimental design under alternative conditions

- Greater confidence in generalizability across contexts
- Less worry about [sampling error]{.alert}
  - Not a major concern with 38,000+ obs per treatment group

. . .

Tons of replication efforts for GGL's experiment

- [Mann 2010](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-010-9124-y) in the 2007 Kentucky gubernatorial election
- [Panagopoulos 2010](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-010-9114-0) in 2007 elections in Monticello, IA and Holland, MI
- [Rogers et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2017.02.004) in the 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall
- [Gerber et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177/1532673X16686556) across 17 states in 2014 midterms

::: {style="margin-top: -40px;"}
(but most polisci experiments don't get nearly this much attention!)
:::

## Costliness

Not trivial to replicate a field experiment of this scope

Just sending out the mailers would cost about $70,000

```{r}
cost_per_mailer <- 0.30
inflation_since_2006 <- 1.548
number_of_mailers <- sum(df_ggl$treatment != "Control")

cost_per_mailer * inflation_since_2006 * number_of_mailers
```

- Many interesting questions won't get a large-scale experimental study
- Need to draw inferences from "messier" research designs

## Ethics: Micro

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](ggl_neighbors_mailer.png)
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
Info is from public records

...but people may not expect it to be publicized

*"many recipients of the Neighbors message called the phone number provided on the mailing and demanded to be removed from future mailing lists"*

Is it ok to make people [feel]{.underline} like their privacy has been violated?
:::
::::

## Ethics: Macro

Study population was a non-representative subset of eligible voters

- Live on streets with 4+ households, but few apartments $\leadsto$
  - wealthier than average
  - more suburban, less rural or urban than average
- Unlikely to vote in Dem primary $\leadsto$
  - whiter than average
  - more male and/or married than average

Could you change not just turnout but also [outcomes]{.underline} by only intervening on this subset of eligible voters?

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

1. Discussed the specifics of GGL's experimental design
   - Treatment tailored to study extrinsic component of civic duty
   - Different comparisons capture different questions
   - Evidence suggests relatively large effect of extrinsic concern
   
2. Discussed potential issues with experiments
   - External validity concerns $\leadsto$ Replication required
   - Ethical concerns $\leadsto$ Manipulating treatment assignment means we're [affecting]{.underline} the political processes we set out to study
