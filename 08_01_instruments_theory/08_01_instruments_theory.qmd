## Recap

Approaches to causal inference so far

1. Randomized treatment assignment
   - Selection bias eliminated by design
   - Diff of means $\approx$ average treatment effect

2. Control for all the confounders (conditional independence)
   - Matching
   - Regression with controls

But what if we can't randomize treatment assignment, and some confounders are unmeasured or unobserved?

## Today's agenda

We'll use [instrumental variables]{.alert} to estimate treatment effects

1. Motivating question --- effect of institutions on growth
   - Correlational evidence
   - Difficulties for causal inference

2. The instrumental variables approach
   - Key assumptions
   - Local average treatment effects (LATE)

# The puzzle: Institutions and growth

## The Great Divergence

## Do good political institutions cause faster growth?

![](exprop_risk.png){fig-align="center"}

## Do good political institutions cause faster growth?

**Obvious problem** for causal inference: institutions aren't randomly assigned

. . .

**More subtle problem**: Many confounders are hard to measure

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## In-class exercise
Think of as many country-level factors as you can that might influence both *political institutions* and *economic growth rates*.
Would any of these be difficult to measure systematically?
:::

. . .

Unobserved confounding $\leadsto$ matching and regression are biased

- Conditional independence condition fails
- Differences b/w treated and untreated with same observables may not be due to treatment

## AJR's approach

Institutional qualities aren't randomly assigned --- but we can we find any as-if random [influences]{.underline} on institutions?

. . .

AJR say yes: **European settler mortality** in the colonial period

- Disease environment varied across colonies
  - Some diseases very fatal to newcomers, others less so
  - Much less variation in effects on indigenous population
- The proposed causal chain
  1. Low settler mortality →
  2. More settlement by colonizers →
  3. Less extractive colonial institutions →
  4. Less extractive contemporary institutions

## Why does an instrument help with causal inference?

For now, assume AJR are right that settler mortality is as-if random

Why does this one thing let us get around all the unobserved confounding?

1. Can isolate effect of settler mortality on economic development
2. Can isolate effect of settler mortality on political institutions

. . .

And, if settler mortality only affects development *through* institutions:

3. Can work backward to infer effect of institutions on development

**Today's goal:** Figure out why this works


# Intro to instruments

## Ingredients of the analysis

Potential outcomes $Y_{1i}, Y_{0i}$

. . .

::: {.example}
$Y_{1i}$: GDP per capita if institutions are good

$Y_{0i}$: GDP per capita if institutions are bad
:::

. . .

Instrumental variable $Z_i$

. . .

::: {.example}
$Z_i = 1$ for low settler mortality, $Z_i = 0$ for high settler mortality

Need not be binary in general, but this is easiest case to think through
:::

. . .

Potential treatment assignments $D_{1i}, D_{0i}$, given instrument assignment

. . .

::: {.example}
$D_{1i}$: Good institutions if low settler mortality?

$D_{0i}$: Good institutions if high settler mortality?
:::

## What makes an instrumental variable?

An [instrumental variable]{.alert} must satisfy three conditions

1. Independence
   - Instrument is as good as randomly assigned
   - Satisfies independence w.r.t. treatment assignment and outcome

. . .

2. First stage
   - Instrument has nonzero effect on treatment assignment
   - Bigger effect is better for inference

. . .

3. Exclusion restriction
   - Instrument has no *direct* effect on outcome
   - Nor any effect through any other channel besides $D_i$
   - This can be very difficult to justify in practice!

## The IV estimator

Decomposing the "reduced form" effect of instrument on outcome:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{effect of $Z$ on $Y$}
&= \ub{(\text{effect of $Z$ on $D$}) \cdot (\text{effect of $D$ on $Y$})}{indirect effect} \\
&\quad + \; \text{direct effect of $Z$ on $Y$}
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

Exclusion restriction $\leadsto$ Direct effect = 0

. . .

First stage $\leadsto$ Effect of Z on D ≠ 0

. . .

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{effect of $D$ on $Y$}
&= \frac{\text{effect of $Z$ on $Y$}}{\text{effect of $Z$ on $D$}} \\[0.5em]
&\approx \frac{\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 1] - \avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 0]}{\avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 1] - \avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 0]}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Thinking through the first stage

**Always takers:** $D_{1i} = D_{0i} = 1$

::: {.example}
Countries that would have good institutions regardless of settler mortality
:::

. . .

**Never takers:** $D_{1i} = D_{0i} = 0$

::: {.example}
Countries that would have bad institutions regardless of settler mortality
:::

. . .

**Compliers:** $D_{1i} = 1$, $D_{0i} = 0$

::: {.example}
Countries that would have good institutions with low settler mortality, but bad institutions with high settler mortality
:::

. . .

**Deniers:** $D_{1i} = 0$, $D_{0i} = 1$

::: {.example}
Countries that would have good institutions with high settler mortality, but bad institutions with low settler mortality

We typically assume there are no deniers
:::

## What IV is estimating

We typically don't want to assume the treatment effect is uniform

. . .

IV estimation relies heavily on the compliers

. . .

IV estimates a [local average treatment effect (LATE)]{.alert}

- Average treatment effect among the set of compliers
- $\E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \mid D_{1i} = 1, D_{0i} = 0]$

. . .

Fundamental prob of causal inference $\leadsto$ Can't discern which obs are compliers, always takers, or never takers

## Why IV estimates the LATE

Imagine the data looks like this:

| Subpopulation | Proportion | Baseline average $Y_{0i}$ | Avg treatment effect |
| :------------ | :--------- | :------------------------ | :------------------- |
| Always takers | 1/2        | 10                        | 2                    |
| Compliers     | 1/4        | 4                         | 4                    |
| Never takers  | 1/4        | 2                         | 0                    |

: {tbl-colwidths="[20, 15, 35, 30]"}

Also imagine same fraction of each group gets Z = 1 (independence)

. . .

$\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 1] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 8 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = 8.5$

. . .

$\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 0] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 4 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = 7.5$

. . .

Reduced form: $\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 1] - \avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 0] = 8.5 - 7.5 = 1$

## Why IV estimates the LATE {visibility="uncounted"}

Imagine the data looks like this:

| Subpopulation | Proportion | Baseline average $Y_{0i}$ | Avg treatment effect |
| :------------ | :--------- | :------------------------ | :------------------- |
| Always takers | 1/2        | 10                        | 2                    |
| Compliers     | 1/4        | 4                         | 4                    |
| Never takers  | 1/4        | 2                         | 0                    |

: {tbl-colwidths="[20, 15, 35, 30]"}

Also imagine same fraction of each group gets Z = 1 (independence)

. . .

First stage: $\avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 1] - \avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 0] = 0.25$ (% compliers)

. . .

IV estimate equals ATE among compliers: $$\frac{\text{reduced form}}{\text{first stage}} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4$$

## Bonus slide: Why IV estimates the LATE, in general

| Subpopulation | Proportion | Baseline average $Y_{0i}$ | Avg treatment effect |
| :------------ | :--------- | :------------------------ | :------------------- |
| Always takers | $q_a$      | $y_a$                     | $\tau_a$             |
| Compliers     | $q_c$      | $y_c$                     | $\tau_c$             |
| Never takers  | $q_n$      | $y_n$                     | $\tau_n$             |

: {tbl-colwidths="[20, 20, 30, 30]"}

\begin{align}
\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 1] &= q_a (y_a + \tau_a) + q_c (y_c + \tau_c) + q_n y_n \\
\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 0] &= q_a (y_a + \tau_a) + q_c y_c + q_n y_n \\
\avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 1] &= q_a + q_c \\
\avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 0] &= q_a \\
\text{IV est} &= \frac{\avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 1] - \avg[Y_i \mid Z_i = 0]}{\avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 1] - \avg[D_i \mid Z_i = 0]} \\
&= \frac{q_c \tau_c}{q_c} = \tau_c.
\end{align}

## Limitations of the IV technique

1. LATE ≠ ATE
   - Must either care about complier effect specifically
   - ...or have reason to think overall effect not much different

2. Big standard errors
   - Essentially throwing away data to isolate randomized part of the effect
   - Particularly acute if first stage is small ([weak instrument]{.alert})

3. Only works under stringent assumptions
   - Exclusion restriction can be very hard to justify
   - e.g., what if disease affected development of port infrastructure?


# Wrapping up

## What we did today

1. AJR's puzzle: Do institutions increase growth?
   - Present-day development strongly correlated w/ institutional quality
   - But tons of confounders, including many hard to observe
   - Settler mortality as potential instrument

2. Instrumental variables assumptions
   - Independence: IV is as-if random
   - First stage: IV affects treatment assignment
   - Exclusion restriction: IV only affects outcome through treatment

3. Local average treatment effect
   - IV only yields average among compliers

**Next time:** IV estimation in practice, including with control variables
