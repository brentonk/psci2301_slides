## Recap

Last week --- [the potential outcomes model]{.alert}

1. Causal effects as differences in potential outcomes, $\tau_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$
2. Observed difference in means $\neq$ avg treatment effect (usually)
   - Treatment group not representative of full population
   - ... except under the [independence condition:]{.alert} No covariance between potential outcomes and treatment assignment
3. How can we meet the independence condition?
   (a) Experimentally manipulate treatment assignment
   (b) Condition on confounding variables
   (c) Look for natural experiments with "as-if random" assignment

## Today's agenda

[Randomized experiments:]{.alert} Most reliable path to causal inference

... but also the most difficult to pull off in practice  
 

1. Motivating question: How does social pressure affect voting?
2. Basic experimental design
3. Why randomization ensures the independence condition holds


# Motivating question: Social pressure and voting

## Voting: the cost-benefit calculus

Voting is costly

- Registration
- Remembering when the election is held
- Learning about the candidates
- Standing in line on Election Day, or figuring out how to vote early

. . .

...and yet the direct political benefits are [infinitesimal]{.alert}

Chances are, your vote will never decide an election

## The probability of being pivotal

Imagine there are only 500 other voters

Close election: Each other voter 50% to vote R, 50% to vote D

What's the probability your vote will decide the election?

. . .

```{r pivotal_500}
dbinom(250, 500, 0.5)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Binomial distribution in R
`dbinom(x, n, p)` = probability of exactly `x` successes in `n` independent trials, each with probability `p` of success.
:::

## The probability of being pivotal

```{r pivotal_graph}
#| cache: true

pr_pivotal <- function(voters) {
  half_voters <- round(voters / 2)
  dbinom(half_voters, 2 * half_voters, 0.5)
}
df_pivotal <- tibble(voters = 10^seq(3.4, 9, length.out = 101),
                     pivotal = pr_pivotal(voters))

                     labels = scales::percent)
```

## The "duty" logic of voting

If your vote is very unlikely to swing the race, why is turnout so high?

Two explanations:

1. People are idiots who don't realize they won't swing the election
2. Something other than pivotality probability motivates voting

. . .

Political scientists generally think it's #2 --- [civic duty]{.alert}

But this bundles multiple things together

- Intrinsic motivation: I vote because I personally find it important
- Extrinsic motivation: I vote because of social norms/pressure to do so

## Correlational evidence for extrinsic motivation

## From correlation to causation

[Treatment $D_i$:]{.alert} Feel pressure to vote from close peers

[Outcome $Y_i$:]{.alert} Turning out to vote

- $Y_{1i}$: vote if feel pressure?
- $Y_{0i}$: vote if feel no pressure?

<hr>

**Exercise:**

1. Identify a [confounding variable]{.alert} in this relationship

2. Explain in words why it's a confounding variable

3. Explain precisely why we'd expect the independence condition to fail


# Basic experimental design

## Motivation for experimentation

We want to know --- How does social pressure affect turnout?

. . . 

The inferential problem --- Lots of confounders

- People who feel more social pressure may be unlike others
- Observed correlation unlikely to represent true causal effect

. . .

Gerber, Green, Larimer solution: [Randomize]{.alert} exposure to social pressure

## The experimental ideals

*Ex ante*, every unit in sample has same probability of getting treated

- [Don't]{.underline} be thoughtful and tailor who gets what treatment
- Doesn't need to be 50% chance for everyone, just same for everyone
- Administer treatment appropriately if spillovers are likely
  - e.g., GGL mailers go to households instead of individuals

$\leadsto$ No [systematic]{.underline} differences between treatment and comparison groups

## Modes of experiment

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Lab experiment:** Recruit subjects, observe outcomes in lab

- Easier to monitor compliance
- Easier to prevent spillovers
- More detailed outcome measures
- Lower sample sizes (usually)
- More external validity concerns
- Fewer ethical concerns (usually)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Field experiment:** Randomize treatment "in the wild"

- Harder to monitor compliance
- Harder to prevent spillovers
- Coarser outcome measures
- Higher sample sizes (usually)
- Better "real world" takeaways
- ...but also more ethical peril

# How randomization ensures independence

## Randomization and the independence condition

::: {.callout-note}
## Independence: The mathematical condition
No correlation between potential outcomes and treatment assignment:
\begin{align}
\C[Y_{1i}, D_i] &= 0 \\
\C[Y_{0i}, D_i] &= 0
\end{align}
:::

. . .

Random assignment with prob. $p$ $\Leftrightarrow$ for all possible $y_1$ and $y_0$, $$\Pr[D_i = 1 \mid Y_{1i} = y_1, Y_{0i} = y_0] = p$$

. . .

$\leadsto$ $\E[Y_{1i} \mid D_i = 1] = \E[Y_{1i} \mid D_i = 0]$ (and same for $Y_{0i}$)

. . .

$\leadsto$ Independence condition holds

## Randomization and independence in samples

In any given sample, treatment group might not be fully representative

::: {.example}
"randomization failure"

e.g., possible --- but unlikely --- for everyone under 40 to end up in treatment and everyone 40+ to end up in comparison
:::

Difference of means only [approximates]{.underline} average treatment effect in sample

Greater sample size $\Rightarrow$ closer approximation

## Randomization and independence in samples

Small sample $\rightarrow$ randomization failure easy

```{r samp_small}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
#| fig-height: 3.75
#| fig-width: 10
set.seed(40404)
df_wide <- tibble(
  id  = 1:4,
  age = c(25, 35, 45, 55),
  y0  = 10 + age + runif(4, -5, 5)
) |>
  mutate(y1 = y0 + 10)
df_long <- df_wide |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("y0", "y1"),
               names_to = "potential_outcome",
               values_to = "value") |>
  mutate(potential_outcome = factor(potential_outcome, levels = c("y1", "y0")))

df_long |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = value)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = potential_outcome), shape = 21, color = "black", size = 6) +
  lims(y = c(35, 75)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Outcome", fill = "Potential Outcome")
```

4 observations $\leadsto$ 33% chance treatment and control separated by age

## Randomization and independence in samples

Small sample $\rightarrow$ randomization failure easy

```{r samp_small_facet}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
#| fig-height: 3.75
#| fig-width: 10

## 3.  Generate all possible assignments for 2 out of 4 in treatment
assignments <- combn(4, 2, simplify = FALSE)

# 4.  Convert these to a lookup table: for each of the 6 ways,
#     we mark which 'id' (1..4) is in treatment (TRUE/FALSE).
assignment_lookup <- map2_dfr(
  assignments,
  seq_along(assignments),
  ~ tibble(
    assignment_id = .y,
    id            = 1:4,
    treat         = (df_wide$id %in% .x)
  )
)

# 5.  Join back with the long data. Here 'id' matches exactly,
#     so there are no extra NA rows.
df_assigned <- df_long |>
  inner_join(assignment_lookup, by = "id") |>
  mutate(
    alpha = case_when(
      treat & potential_outcome == "y1" ~ 1,    # treat → y1 is opaque
      treat & potential_outcome == "y0" ~ 0.2,  # treat → y0 is faint
      !treat & potential_outcome == "y0" ~ 1,   # control → y0 is opaque
      TRUE ~ 0.2                                # control → y1 is faint
    )
  )

# 6.  Plot, facetting on assignment_id
ggplot(df_assigned, aes(x = age, y = value)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = potential_outcome, alpha = alpha),
             shape = 21, size = 4, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ assignment_id) +
  scale_alpha_identity() +
  lims(y = c(35, 75)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Outcome", fill = "Potential Outcome")
```

4 observations $\leadsto$ 33% chance treatment and control separated by age

## Randomization and independence in samples

Large sample $\rightarrow$ randomization failure much harder

```{r samp_large}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
#| fig-height: 3.75
#| fig-width: 10
set.seed(40405)
df_larger <- tibble(
  age = runif(100, 25, 55),
  y0  = 10 + age + runif(100, -5, 5)
) |>
  mutate(y1 = y0 + 10,
         obs = sample(rep(c("y0", "y1"), 50))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("y0", "y1"),
               names_to = "potential_outcome",
               values_to = "value") |>
  mutate(alpha = if_else(potential_outcome == obs, 1, 0.2),
         potential_outcome = factor(potential_outcome, levels = c("y1", "y0")))
df_larger |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = value)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = potential_outcome), shape = 21, color = "black", size = 6) +
  lims(y = c(35, 75)) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Outcome", fill = "Potential Outcome")
```

100 observations $\leadsto$ 0.000000000000000000000000002% chance treatment and control separated by age

## Checking for randomization failure

Can't directly check whether independence condition holds

But can check for [balance]{.alert} on observable characteristics

::: {.example}
Should be measured [before]{.underline} treatment administered
:::

Ideal: Similar distribution between treatment and comparison

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

1. Asked how social pressure affects voting
   - Those who report more pressure also vote more...
   - but lots of reasons to suspect that correlation isn't causal
   
2. Reviewed very basics of experimental design
   - Prob of treatment should be same for all units
   - Ideal is for treatment and control to be representative of full sample
   
3. Showed how randomization implies independence condition
   - Equal assignment probability $\leadsto$ no correlation of potential outcomes and treatment assignment in population
   - Randomization failure possible in any given sample, but unlikely in large sample

## Next time

1. Gerber, Green, Larimer's design and results
2. Potential pitfalls of randomized experiments
