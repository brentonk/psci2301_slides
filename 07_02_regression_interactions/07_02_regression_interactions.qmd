## Recap

Last time --- regression for causal inference

1. The linear model with controls
   - Reduce standard errors by isolating treatment effect
   - Control for selection bias

2. Interpreting regression output
   - "All else equal" comparison
   - Don't try to interpret control variable coefficients

## Today's agenda

Regression with interaction terms

1. Heterogeneous effects and why we might look for them
2. Interaction with a categorical variable
3. Interaction with a continuous variable
   - Linear interaction approach
   - Discretization approach


# Heterogeneous effects and the interactive model

## Heterogeneous effects: What they are, why we care

We've mostly focused on overall average treatment effects

Sometimes we suspect different average effects across subpopulations

::: {.example}
e.g., does social pressure affect turnout differently for men and women?
:::

. . .

Reasons to look for these [heterogeneous effects]{.alert}

- Theoretical
  - Think about mechanisms --- why you expect treatment to be effective
  - Would the mechanism be stronger/weaker for some groups?

- Practical
  - How can the treatment be targeted most effectively?
  - e.g., can we get most of the votes for a fraction of the cost?

## Heterogeneous effects in randomized experiments

Potential outcomes $Y_{1i}, Y_{0i}$

Treatment indicator $D_i$

Binary group indicator $X_i$

::: {.example}
e.g., $X_i = 1$ for men, $X_i = 0$ for women
:::

. . .

Overall average treatment effect $\E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}]$

Average treatment effect among men $\E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \mid X_i = 1]$

Average treatment effect among women $\E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} \mid X_i = 0]$

::: {.example}
same subgroup effects we calculate for subclassification,
now just treating them as interesting on their own
:::

## Capturing heterogeneous effects with a linear model

Regression with an [interaction term]{.alert}:
$$
\E[Y_i \mid D_i, Z_i] = \alpha + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 X_i + \ub{\beta_3 (D_i \times X_i)}{interaction term}
$$

::: {.smaller .incremental}
- $\alpha$: average outcome in control condition among $X_i = 0$ subgroup
  - voter turnout among women who don't receive the GOTV mailer
- $\beta_1$: average treatment effect in $X_i = 0$ subgroup
  - average effect of mailer on turnout among women
- $\beta_2$: difference in avg outcome in control cond. b/w $X_i = 1$ and $X_i = 0$
  - among those w/ no mailer, how much more/less is men's turnout?
- $\beta_3$ difference in ATE b/w $X_i = 1$ and $X_i = 0$
  - how much more/less does mailer affect turnout among men?
:::

## Recap: The GGL turnout data

```{r download}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
df_ggl <- read_csv("http://hdl.handle.net/10079/d3669799-4537-411e-b175-d9e837324c35") |>
  mutate(voted = if_else(voted == "Yes", 1, 0))
```

```{r}
print(df_ggl)
```

To begin --- just look at Neighbors treatment vs no mailer

```{r}
df_ggl_subset <- df_ggl |>
  filter(treatment %in% c("Neighbors", "Control")) |>
  mutate(treat = if_else(treatment == "Neighbors", 1, 0))
```

## Estimating an interactive model in R

```{r}
fit_interact <- lm(voted ~ treat * sex, data = df_ggl_subset)
tidy(fit_interact)
```

. . .

| Term          | Value  | Interpretation                                               |
| :------------ | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| (Intercept)   | 0.290  | 29% turnout among women in Control group                     |
| treat         | 0.081  | 8.1% ATE among women                                         |
| sexmale       | 0.012  | 1.2% higher turnout among men in Control group (i.e., 30.2%) |
| treat:sexmale | 0.0008 | 0.08% higher ATE among men (i.e., 8.18%)                     |

## Another discrete interaction example

Divide into three categories based on household size:

```{r}
df_ggl_subset <- df_ggl_subset |>
  mutate(hh_type = case_when(
           hh_size == 1 ~ "Single",
           hh_size == 2 ~ "Couple",
           TRUE ~ "More than two"))

fit_hh_type <- lm(voted ~ treat * hh_type, data = df_ggl_subset)
tidy(fit_hh_type)
```

## Heterogeneous effects across a continuous variable

What if we wanted to see whether the treatment effect varies by age?

. . .

Linear interactive effect model
$$
\E[Y_i \mid D_i, X_i] = \alpha + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 X_i + \beta_3 (D_i \times X_i)
$$

Same equation as before, but new interpretation

. . .

Average treatment effect when $X_i = x$:
$$
\E[Y_i \mid D_i = 1, X_i = x] - \E[Y_i \mid D_i = 0, X_i = x] = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x
$$

<br>

$\beta_3$ = how much does treatment effect increase/decrease with each unit of $X_i$?

## Heterogeneous effects across a continuous variable

```{r}
fit_interact_age <- lm(voted ~ treat * yob, data = df_ggl_subset)
tidy(fit_interact_age)
```

. . .

ATE = 1.31 - 0.000628 $\times$ birth year

- born 1925: 10.11% turnout increase
- born 1950: 8.54% turnout increase
- born 1975: 6.97% turnout increase

## Heterogeneous effects across a continuous variable

```{r}
library("interplot")
interplot(m = fit_interact_age, var1 = "treat", var2 = "yob")
```

## Heterogeneous effects across a continuous variable

Problem with the standard approach --- is ATE linear in age?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_ggl_subset |>
  group_by(yob, treatment) |>
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    turnout = mean(voted)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = yob, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = treatment, size = n))
```

## Heterogenous effects across a continuous variable

Another approach --- discretize the continuous variable

```{r}
df_ggl_subset <- df_ggl_subset |>
  mutate(yob_cat = cut(yob - 1900, breaks = seq(0, 90, by = 10)))

df_ggl_subset |> relocate(yob_cat, yob)
```

## Heterogeneous effects across a continuous variable

```{r}
fit_yob_cat <- lm(voted ~ treat * yob_cat, data = df_ggl_subset)
tidy(fit_yob_cat)
```

## Heterogeneous effects in observational data

What if you're looking for heterogeneous effects when treatment isn't randomly assigned?

Methods are essentially the same --- just include controls alongside the interaction

You *can* include multiple interactions but interpretation gets tricky

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

1. Reasons to look for heterogeneous effects
   - Theoretical: where we expect mechanisms to be stronger/weaker
   - Practical: targeting implementation to get max effect
2. Interpreting interactive regressions
   - Coefficient on interaction term = *difference* in treatment effects
   - Special considerations for interaction w/ continuous variable

## Next week

What if we can't measure and control for every plausible confounder?

One way to deal with unobserved confounding --- [instrumental variables]{.alert}

::: {.example}
Essentially, random *influences* on non-random treatment assignment

1. Turn in project proposal [this Friday]{.alert}
2. Read Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, "The Colonial Origins of Economic Development"
3. Read chapter 3 of *Mastering 'Metrics*
