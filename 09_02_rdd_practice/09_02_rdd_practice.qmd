## Recap

Last time: Estimating treatment effects by [regression discontinuity]{.alert}

- Another method for observational data w/ unobserved confounders

- Key assumptions
  1. Treatment assignment determined by sharp cutoff in continuous "running variable"
  2. No major dissimilarities in other background characteristics just below/above the cutoff

- Linear relationship between running and outcome: linear RDD

- Nonlinear relationship: polynomial RDD, or local linear RDD w/in bandwidth

## Today's agenda

Working with RDD in practice, using Hall's data

1. Initial visual inspections

2. Estimating RDD models
   - Linear RDD via `lm()`
   - Polynomial RDD via `lm()`
   - Automatic bandwidth selection via `rdrobust()`

3. Assessing balance


# Effects of ideological extremism in House races

## Research design

What is the effect of ideological extremism on a candidate's election results?

**Population:** US House races, 1980--2010

- Only those with a competitive primary
- ...and a discernible ideological difference b/w primary candidates

**Outcome:** Vote share in general election

**Treatment group:** Ideological extremists

**Comparison group:** Ideological moderates

## Measuring primary candidate ideology

Typically measure legislator ideology by how they voted on bills

## Measuring primary candidate ideology

Problem: Don't observe bill votes for candidates who weren't elected

Hall's solution: Measure ideology by [donation]{.underline} patterns

- Lots of data: All donations of $200+ must be publicly reported
- Key assumption: Donors favor ideologically close candidates

. . .

Rough outline of how this works:

1. Measure ideology of incumbents the usual way
2. Measure donor ideology via which incumbents they contribute to
3. Measure candidate ideology as weighted average of donor ideology

## Accessing Hall's data

Can download manually from <https://www.andrewbenjaminhall.com/>

...or can copy-paste this:

```{r}
#| cache: true
library("archive")
library("haven")
url_hall <- "https://www.dropbox.com/s/1o0lrqemdlyh7ha/Hall_Extremist_Primaries_APSR_Replication.zip?dl=1"
con <- archive_read(url_hall, file = "primary_analysis.dta")
df_hall <- read_dta(con)
```

## Hall's data

```{r}
# Only use races w/ above-median ideological difference
# (as in Hall's main analysis)
df_hall <- df_hall |>
  filter(absdist > median(absdist)) |>
  relocate(state, dist, year, dem, dv, rv, treat)

df_hall
```

## Looking at the data

Plot raw data to assess linearity + discontinuity

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_hall |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, y = dv, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "General election vote share"
  )
```

## A closer look at the data

Restricting to when extremist won/lost by 5% or less

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_hall |>
  filter(abs(rv) <= 0.05) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, y = dv, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "General election vote share"
  )
```

## Polynomial RDD

```{r}
#| echo: false
options(width = 42)
```

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
fit_cubic <- lm(
  dv ~ treat + rv + I(rv^2) + I(rv^3),
  data = df_hall
)
tidy(fit_cubic)
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{r}
fit_quintic <- lm(
  dv ~ treat + rv + I(rv^2) + I(rv^3) +
    I(rv^4) + I(rv^5),
  data = df_hall
)
tidy(fit_quintic)
```
:::
::::

## Checking fit of polynomial RDD: Cubic model

```{r}
#| echo: false
fit_cubic |>
  augment(newdata = df_hall) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(aes(y = dv)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "General election vote share"
  )
```

## Checking fit of polynomial RDD: Quintic model

```{r}
#| echo: false
fit_quintic |>
  augment(newdata = df_hall) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(aes(y = dv)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted), color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "General election vote share"
  )
```

## Local linear RDD with manual bandwidth choice

```{r}
#| echo: false
options(width = 90)
```

```{r}
fit_local_linear <- lm(
  dv ~ treat * rv,
  data = df_hall,
  subset = margin < 0.05
)
tidy(fit_local_linear)
```

## Considerations in bandwidth choice

We face a **bias-variance** tradeoff in selecting a bandwidth

Narrow bandwidth

- Low bias: Only comparing very similar observations
- High variance: Throwing away lots of data

Wide bandwidth

- High(er) bias: Comparing observations with more baseline diffs
- Low(er) variance: Using greater fraction of the data

Statisticians have developed methods to balance these two considerations

## Choosing bandwidth automatically

Using the **rdrobust** package:

```{r}
# install.packages("rdrobust") if not installed already
library("rdrobust")
```

`rdrobust()` function automatically estimates bandwidth + corrects SEs

```{r}
fit_rdr <- rdrobust(y = df_hall$dv, x = df_hall$rv, c = 0)
```

In here we'll just use the defaults, but there are **lots** of options to check before using `rdrobust()` for production/publication work

## Choosing bandwidth automatically

Sadly our friend `tidy()` doesn't work for `rdrobust()` output

```{r}
summary(fit_rdr)
```

## Checking balance

Key RDD assumption: Obs essentially similar on either side of threshold

Want to verify there's **no** discontinuity for observed confounders

Confounding variables in Hall's analysis:

- `winner_female`: Was the winning candidate female?
- `inc_winner`: Was the winning candidate an incumbent?
- `qual`: Did the winning candidate have prior political experience?
- `winner_share`: How big was the winning candidate's fundraising (dis)advantage?

## Balance check regressions

```{r}
# Extract optimal bandwidth from dv analysis
bandwidth <- fit_rdr$bws[1]
df_hall_subset <- filter(df_hall, abs(rv) <= bandwidth)

# Local linear RDD for each confounding variable
fit_fem <- lm(winner_female ~ treat * rv, data = df_hall_subset)
fit_inc <- lm(inc_winner ~ treat * rv, data = df_hall_subset)
fit_exp <- lm(qual ~ treat * rv, data = df_hall_subset)
fit_don <- lm(winner_share ~ treat * rv, data = df_hall_subset)
```

## Balance check regressions

```{r}
#| echo: false
options(width = 45)
```

For once we want **high** p-values

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
tidy(fit_fem) |> filter(term == "treat")
tidy(fit_inc) |> filter(term == "treat")
```
:::
::: {.column}
```{r}
tidy(fit_exp) |> filter(term == "treat")
tidy(fit_don) |> filter(term == "treat")
```
:::
::::

## Visual balance check: Gender

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_hall_subset |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, y = winner_female, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.05)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "Was winning candidate female?"
  )
```

## Visual balance check: Incumbency

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_hall_subset |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, y = inc_winner, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.05)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "Was winning candidate an incumbent?"
  )
```

## Visual balance check: Experience

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_hall_subset |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, y = qual, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.05)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "Was winning candidate a past officeholder?"
  )
```

## Visual balance check: Fundraising

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_hall_subset |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rv, y = winner_share, group = treat)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0.05)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Running variable: Extremist candidate's margin in primary",
    y = "Winning candidate's share of primary donations"
  )
```


# Wrapping up

## What we did today

RDD in practice

1. Starting point: Look at the data!
   - Is there an evident discontinuity in the raw data?
   - How close to the threshold is the relationship roughly linear?

2. Many different ways to estimate RDDs
   - Linear and polynomial via `lm()`
   - Automatic bandwidth selection via `rdrobust()`
   - Use multiple methods to see if results are broadly consistent

3. Assessing balance visually and with statistical tests
   - Ideal is no discontinuity in confounders
