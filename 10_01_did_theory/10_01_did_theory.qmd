## Recap

Last time we met: [Regression discontinuity designs]{.alert}

- Method for observational data with unobserved confounders
- Key assumptions
  - Treatment status determined by cutoff in "running variable"
  - No discontinuities in confounders/other background characteristics near the treatment cutoff
- Application: Estimating effects of candidate extremism
  - RDD on margin in primaries b/w extremist and moderate
  - Assumes districts where extremist *barely* wins primary not very different from those where moderate barely wins
  - Estimate sizable advantage for moderates in general election

## Today's agenda

[Difference in differences]{.alert} (DiD):

- Another method for observational data w/ unobserved confounders
- Data requirements
  - Observe same units over time
  - Some units never treated, others sometimes treated
- How to estimate the causal effect of treatment?
  1. Calculate diff over time among sometimes-treated obs
  2. Calculate diff over time among never-treated obs
  3. Subtract (2) from (1)
- Relies on [parallel trends]{.alert} assumption: if treated units had not been treated, would have had same average trend over time as untreated ones


# Motivating question: Border walls and crime

## Causal question

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
What is the effect of physical barriers on smuggling across borders?

Context --- early-2000s barriers b/w Israel and West Bank

- Primary motivation: deter suicide attacks
- But most car theft at time also went to West Bank
- Did wall construction reduce car theft, or just displace it?

## Difficulties for causal inference

Obviously can't randomize $\leadsto$ experimental study impossible

. . .

What about regression/matching?

- Need to control for all confounders
- Not realistic here: would need everything that affects car theft rates + proximity to border wall construction

. . .

Other strategies?

- IV: hard to think of as-if random variation in wall construction, let alone one that would satisfy exclusion restriction
- RDD: no running variable that determines treatment status

## Getmansky, Grossman, Wright's approach

Three groups to compare:

- North: barrier built in early 2000s
- South: barrier not yet completed in early 2000s
- Outer: no barrier, stolen cars not going to West Bank

Observe car theft rates in each place [before and after]{.underline} 2002 construction

. . .

[Difference in differences:]{.alert}

- Calculate pre-2002 vs post-2002 difference in theft in each region
- Compare these differences to draw causal inferences


# Differences in differences

## Key ingredients

Standard causal model, with two changes

1. We observe each unit at two times: $t = 1$ and $t = 2$
2. Units are only treated at time $t = 2$, and only some of them

. . .

Potential outcomes in first period: $Y_{0i}^{1}$, $Y_{1i}^1$

Potential outcomes in second period: $Y_{0i}^2$, $Y_{1i}^2$

Treatment group indicator: $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$

* $D_i = 0$ $\leadsto$ control both periods
* $D_i = 1$ $\leadsto$ control period 1, treatment period 2

## Bad option #1: Before-and-after comparison

What if we ignored control, just did before-and-after with treated?

Before-and-after estimator:
$$
\hat{\tau} = \E[Y_i^2 \mid D_i = 1] - \E[Y_i^1 \mid D_i = 1]
$$

. . .

Problem: Must assume would have been no change if not treated

Only equals ATT if $\E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 1] = \E[Y_{0i}^1 \mid D_i = 1]$

## Bad option #2: Period 2 comparison

What if we ignored $t = 1$, just compared treated to control at $t = 2$?

Period 2 difference of means estimator:
$$
\hat{\tau} = \E[Y_i^2 \mid D_i = 1] - \E[Y_i^2 \mid D_i = 0]
$$

. . .

Problem: Must assume the usual independence condition!

Only equals ATT if $\E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 0] = \E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 1]$

## A better option: Difference in differences

We need a good guess about $\E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 1]$

- Avg t = 2 outcome among treated obs if they hadn't been treated

. . .

Avg t = 1 outcome among treated obs doesn't work

- Could have been change over time even if untreated

. . .

Avg t = 2 outcome among untreated obs doesn't work

- Could be systematic differences due to non-random assignment

. . .

But we can **combine** these to get a better guess

## Difference in differences

The [difference in differences]{.alert} estimate of the ATT:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\tau}
&= \left\{ \E[Y_i^2 \mid D_i = 1] - \E[Y_i^1 \mid D_i = 1] \right\} \\
&\quad - \left\{ \E[Y_i^2 \mid D_i = 0] - \E[Y_i^1 \mid D_i = 0] \right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

Key assumption that makes this work: [parallel trends]{.alert}

- If not treated, treatment group would have had same [change]{.underline} as control
- Formal condition:
  $$
  \begin{multlined}
  \textcolor{red}{\E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 1]} - \E[Y_{0i}^1 \mid D_i = 1]
  \\ = \E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 0] - \E[Y_{0i}^1 \mid D_i = 0]
  \end{multlined}
  $$

## Assessing parallel trends

Not directly testable, as we can't observe $\E[Y_{0i}^2 \mid D_i = 1]$

How to convince yourself + others this assumption is valid?

- Know your data!
  - Why did only some observations get the treatment?
  - What accounts for differences b/w treatment and control at t = 1?
  - Any other changes at same time that'd only affect treatment group?

- If data available for earlier periods, do trends look parallel?

# Wrapping up

## What we did today

The difference in differences estimator:

- Data requirements
  - Observe same units over time
  - Some units never treated, others sometimes treated
- Method to estimate the ATT
  1. Calculate diff over time among sometimes-treated obs
  2. Calculate diff over time among never-treated obs
  3. Subtract (2) from (1)
- Parallel trends assumption
  - If treated units had not been treated, would have had same average trend over time as untreated ones
  - Not directly testable (fundamental problem of causal inference)

## Plan for the rest of the semester

- Weds 4/2: **No class**
- Mon 4/7: DiD in practice
- Weds 4/9: A crash course on synthetic control
- Mon 4/14: Presentations of final projects
  - Should be 10-12 minutes each
  - Main points to hit: your causal question, your data, how you identify a causal effect, your main findings
- Weds 4/16: Likely no class
